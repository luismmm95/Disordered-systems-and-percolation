    "### Generating a nano-porous material\n",
    "The goal of this project is to gain familiarity with working with a nano-porous material using molecular dynamics modeling. To study a nano-porous material we follow three steps: (1) We generate the nano-porous matrix; (2) We fill the matrix with the fluid we would like to study; and (3) We study the physical processes we are interested in. You may choose for yourself what type of material you would like to work with. We will first describe the general procedure to generate a nano-porous material based on the Lennard-Jones model, but you may extend this to more advanced materials by following the instructions listed for the various potentials below. We strongly advise you to first work with the Lennard-Jones potential before you decide to address any of the more advanced potentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, when we prepare molecular dynamics systems, we follow a sequence of steps similar to what we would do if we were to prepare the system “experimentally”. Here, we will follow a semi-procedural approach to generate first the matrix and then the interior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our plan to generate a porous material is to first generate a thermalized Lennard-Jones system, and then select a given part of the system to be the solid matrix. In the simplest version of our system, we will freeze all the atoms in the matrix - not allowing the atoms to move, but still including them in interactions with atoms moving in the system - generating a non-deformable matrix. We could do this based on a solid LJ crystal. However, this would generate a very regular structure. Instead, we will here start from a LJ liquid system and then select a given number of atoms to form the matrix. We can select the matrix in various ways: For example, we could for each atom randomly decide if the atom is part of the matrix or not, with some probability $p$ for the atom to be part of the matrix. As we will learn later, this will usually lead to a system with very small pores. We could increase the pore size by removing matrix regions that consist of connected clusters of atoms smaller than a certain minimum size. However, we will here pursue a different approach - we will generate a porous material by removing a set of possibly overlapping spheres with random position and radius - leaving everything outside of the spheres as the matrix. We will do this based on a thermalized liquid state of the Argon system."
